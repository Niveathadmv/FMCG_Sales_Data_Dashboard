# FMCG Sales data dashboard using PowerBI

# Introduction
This project showcases a dynamic dashboard designed to transform raw FMCG sales data into insightful information.
XYZ Private Limited is an FMCG distributor for modern trade outlets that delivers products to stores in Chennai and nearby areas. They work with all kinds of shops, from small traditional ones like Kirana shops to big modern trade ones like Hypermarkets and convenience stores.
Not knowing how much they sell could make it hard for them to make smart decisions and grow their business. So, it's really important to figure out the challenges they face as a distributor. By looking at the information about what they sell and how stores buy from them, the company can better understand what the customers want. This helps the organization give the consumers the right products at the right time, meeting their needs and making the business better.

# Data preprocessing
The data was received in the form of an Excel file. To clean and transform the data, I used Excel, Power Query in PowerBI, and Jupyter Notebook. This involved removing duplicates and addressing other inconsistencies observed in the data.

# Key Insights

* The organization provided data for the years 2019 and 2020, showing that a total of 247 retailers generated bills amounting to 69,658 for both years combined.

* Approximately 2% of the total sales value have been returned to the distributor.

* 2% of the total sales value has been given to the retailers as discounts.

* The FMCG organization records the highest sales during August and July followed by dips in September and October. Similarly, we can see an increase in January followed by a dip in Feb. The reason perhaps would be because itâ€™s a distributor company retailers tend to place bulk orders in certain months resulting in a reduced number of orders in the following months.

* The majority of retailers in the organization (55.57%) are from convenience stores, followed by hypermarkets and supermarkets. Sales through e-commerce are very low.

* Almost all the bills, about 95%, were received successfully, and only a small 3% of the bills were canceled.

* Detergents make up the highest share of sales at 55%, followed by personal products, beverages, and food products.

* Within the detergent category, laundry fabric wash generates the highest sales value, closely followed by tea.

* Future retail store contributes 10% to the total sales value among the retailers.
